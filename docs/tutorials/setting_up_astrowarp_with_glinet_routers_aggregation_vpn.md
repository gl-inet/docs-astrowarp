**Step 4:** After creating the network, manually drag the connection point from the router to the cloud gateway within the interface. Once this step is completed, the aggregation connection will be successfully established, allowing your router device to access the internet using the aggregated connection.

You can check if our public IP address matches the public IP address of the aggregation node viaÂ [ipaddress.my](https://www.ipaddress.my/){target="_blank"}.

**Step 5:**Once confirmed the IP address, you can test different application scenarios. For example, you can try disconnecting the router's tethering network connection during a video conference to observe if the call is interrupted due to network issues.
